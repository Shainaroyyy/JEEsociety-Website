# JEEsociety Website

A user-centered website designed for JEEsociety to improve credibility, trust, and clarity for students exploring the platform. This project focuses on structured UI/UX decisions, clean design, and seamless information flow — built collaboratively using **Graphy** and **Hostinger**.

This website was approached like a **product**, not just a website, focusing on how a student feels, navigates, and decides while browsing.
